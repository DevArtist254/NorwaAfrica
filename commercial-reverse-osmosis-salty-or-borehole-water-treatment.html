                <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>Sand filter</strong> <br> Although most of the suspended impurities have been removed, a small amount of suspended solids remains in the tap water treated by municipal waterworks. Turbidity and other indicators can not meet the requirements of reverse osmosis membrane for feeding water quality. In order to make the feeding water turbidity of reverse osmosis membrane less than 1ntu, sand filter is the set in front of the system. Sand filtration is a process of water purification, which can effectively remove turbidity by passing raw water through a certain thickness of granular materials. When there are too many impurities in the filter layer, the pores in the filter layer will be blocked, the resistance of water interception will increase, and the filtration speed will be reduced. In order to recover the original filtering speed, it is necessary to wash off the impurities accumulated in the pores of the filter materials with clean water regularly </span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"> <strong>Activated carbon filter</strong> <br> After disinfection of municipal tap water, the residual chlorine at the end of pipe network is strong oxidant. If it is not removed, it will cause irreversible damage to the resin and reverse osmosis membrane. Adsorption treatment with activated carbon can completely remove the residual chlorine. Activated carbon is strong adsorption with large capacity. The main reason is its porous structure, and its specific surface area is as high as 500-700m2 / g. Because of the developed pore structure and large specific surface area, activated carbon can completely adsorb residual chlorine and some organic matters in water, and has good removal effect on color and odor. </span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"> <strong>water softener</strong> <br> The softener is mainly used to remove calcium and magnesium ions which are easy to scale in water, so as to prevent the chemical scaling at the concentrated side of RO membrane, especially the last piece of membrane in the RO machine and damaging the membrane element.</span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"> <strong>Sediment filter and filter cartridge</strong> <br> Sediment filter is the last filter device before raw water entering the RO membrane. It can effectively remove the particles that are bigger than 5um to ensure the RO membrane operate safely and stably.
                    <br>
                    When the pressure difference between sediment filter inlet and outlet surpass 0.5Mpa, filter cartridge should be changed timely. Filter cartridge should be installed in right position, otherwise, it will be damaged or even lost the filtration function.
                     </span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>Feed water solenoid valve</strong> <br> The function of the motorized valve is to shut off the pipeline between raw water and membrane automatically when the equipment stops in order to prevent the water from flowing into membrane and cause pollution to membrane. The specification of the motorized valve is DN32. </span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"> <strong>Low pressure switch</strong> <br> It is a protective device to control the system operation. The value could be set according to the system technics requirement. When the pressure of the raw water supply is lower than the set value, the switch will stop the system automatically to prevent the high pressure pump from running idle when short of water or no water and causing damage. The set value for this system is 0.07Mpa.</span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>High pressure pump</strong> <br> This system adopts CNP pump, model CDL4-14，380V 50HZ. It's an important component of RO main machine. Its function is to supply the water source with a certain flux and pressure. It’s quality has enormous influence on the system. The pump can’t run idle or overload for long period when operation. The air inside should be removed according to requirements frequently, and the electric part should be kept dry.</span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"> <strong>RO Membrane </strong> <br> This system adopts semi-permeable T.F.C. RO membrane, model LP21-4040, 1 - 8 pieces. RO membrane is the key part of the RO system, it decides the capacity and quality of the system</span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>Pump exit regulate valve</strong> <br>The main function of the shutoff valve installed after the pump is to regulate and control the flux of feed water of the RO membrane. It regulates the pressure and water volume inside the membrane when working together with the concentrate regulate valve. The valve should be opened slightly before starting the system, and open gradually when the pump begin operation to prevent the damage to the membrane due to instant high pressure. And then, the operator regulates each and every data. The specification of the regulating valve is DN25.</span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>High pressure switch</strong> <br> Adopt JC-230 of 3S from Korea. It is a protective device to ensure the system is operating below the maximum pressure. When the pressure of the raw water supply is higher than the set value, the switch will stop the high pressure pump automatically. It can prevent the system from high pressure damage. The set value for this system is 15kg/cm2.</span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>Pressure gauge</strong> <br>This system include 3pcs pressure gauge: Pressure gauge before filtration, Pressure gauge after filtration and system pressure gauge. The pressure gauge before and after filtration indicated the pressure the water flow into and flow out sediment filter. When the pressure difference reach to 0.05Mpa, the filtration cartridge need to replace. It is very important in the real operation to know the pressure difference by the two gauges. When regulating the operation parameter, the operator should regulate the pressure on the basis of the system pressure gauge, especially in the condition that the system pressure is on the upper limit and the membrane pressure difference is big. System pressure gauge shows the pressure of water before entering into the membrane.When adjusting the working condition, it need to accord to the system pressure, it should not be higher than 1.5Mpa</span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>Permeate flow meter and concentrate flow meter</strong> <br>The function is to calculate the permeate flow and concentrate flow. By these two meters, the operator can get the data of the permeate flow and concentrate flow, and calculate the ratio for permeate to concentrate water which helps the user to regulate the system according to the ratio and output. </span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>Concentrate regulate valve</strong> <br>This valve is an important part of the RO system. Its main function is to regulate the inner membrane pressure to balance the permeate and concentrate water proportion. It can regulate the inner membrane pressure and permeate output better when working together with the pump exit regulate valve. This system adopts DN32 stainless steel shut-off valve. The valve should be totally opened before the start of this system to prevent the damage due to the pressure soaring of the inner membrane when the system starts.</span>

                The equipment must not be in icing condition (0 ℃). It is recommended that the minimum temperature for equipment maintenance is 5 ℃ to ensure that freezing will not occur. <br>
                1.2 <i>Avoid high temperature</i>
                High temperature should be avoided during transportation, storage and standby. It is recommended that the maximum storage temperature of the equipment under non operating conditions is 40 ℃. Avoid storing or operating the equipment in direct sunlight. Because the temperature inside the RO membrane pressure vessel may exceed the recommended maximum temperature.
                Note:If the temperature is higher than 45 ℃, the water permeability of the membrane will decrease; if the temperature exceeds 50 ℃, the membrane will be damaged. Attention should be paid to the selection of installation site, transportation and storage of RO equipment.
                1.3 <i>Prevent RO membrane dried</i>
                To ensure that RO membrane has moisture at any time, do not open it before start up or during storage.
                1.4 <i>General conditions of storage</i>
                The equipment should be stored in a low temperature and dry place and covered. Make sure that the equipment is not on the way, where it is easy to damage the equipment. For the storage and handling precautions of various chemicals used in reverse osmosis system, please refer to the chemical treatment section of this manual.

                If there are similar oxidants (such as: subbromic acid, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, potassium permanganate, sodium persulfate, chlorine) will cause irreversible damage to the reverse osmosis membrane.
                1.6 <i>Other chemicals</i>
                The raw water and cleaning fluid entering the system shall not contain any components (such as oil, etc.) that are difficult to be mixed with water. The use of these components will cause irreversible blockage to reverse osmosis membrane. Do not use other chemicals not specifically listed in this manual.

              <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>Summary</strong> <br> After a period of normal operation, the surface of the membrane in the system is deposited by some substances (mineral precipitation, biological substances, sediment, etc.), and the interior of the membrane is dark and humid, it is easily reproduction for bacteria and microorganisms. <br>
                There are three related questions to the successful maintenance the membranes: why maintain membranes? What time is suitable for operation and maintenance of osmosis membrane? How to maintain membrane? It will be described as follows. <br>
                </span>
              <br>
              <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>Why maintain membranes?</strong> <br> When RO system running, bacteria in the water are removed, and salt substances harmful to human body are removed as much as possible. In this way, pollutants are blocked on the membrane surface, and accumulated sludge and mineralized sediment (scaly shape) can cause membrane surface blockage, thus reducing membrane permeability and desalination rate. The blockage of biological substances, scales or sludge is deepening, and the blocking of membrane module is also increasing, which leads to the decrease of flow on the membrane surface. At the same time, the reduction of membrane surface flow leads to the gradual blockage of the flow path in the membrane module. Once the channel in the membrane module is blocked, it may be recovered by chemical cleaning. If it cannot be recovered, the membrane module needs to be replaced.</span>
              <br>
              <span class="about__p content__p var"><strong>What time is suitable for operation and maintenance of osmosis membrane?</strong> <br> The membrane module needs to be maintained when there are the following signals and conditions: <br>
                a) RO system has been shut down for more than 5 days. <br>
                b) There are a lot of bacteria in the product water quality analysis. <br>
                c) The desalination rate is 50% higher than that after the first start-up or the last cleaning operation (e.g. 10% to 15%). <br>
                d) The pressure is 20% higher than that of the first start-up or the last cleaning (for example, the raw water pressure of 300 psi minus the concentrated water pressure of 250 psi equals to 50 psi, and the pressure ratio of 50 psi to 60 psi needs maintenance. Note: psi value is using a pressure indicator) <br>
                e) When the production flow is reduced by 10% than which of the first start-up or the last time cleaning. (such as the production flow rate is reduced from 28gpm to 25gpm), it will also be caused if the production flow rate remains unchanged and the raw water pressure increases by 10 <br>

              <br>
              <span class="about__p content__p var"> <strong>How to maintain membrane?</strong> <br> Membrane maintenance is accomplished by chemical cleaning, chemical disinfection or a combination of the two. Usually, the combination of chemical cleaning can achieve good results. <br>
                Note:The design and maintenance of the system is based on the permeate in the membrane module shell and system circulation pipe. <br>
                Cleaning methods is usually depend on contaminants or obstructions. <br>
                The three influential parameters in cleaning are as follows: <br>
                1. Temperature <br>
                2. Speed <br>
                3. Time <br>
                The best cleaning temperature is about 45 ℃, which means that the heating and cooling depends on the environmental conditions. Furthermore, a certain flow rate needs to be distributed to the membrane module to dissolve the insoluble blockage. Finally, it is necessary to operate the CIP pump circularly in order to loosen the blockage on the membrane during soaking.
                Note:For safe operation of chemical cleaning, refer to relevant acid and alkali regulation data and relevant regulations provided by manufacturers
